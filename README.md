# Udacity-Puzzler
An interactive puzzle memory game created as part of the Udacity VR Nanodegree program. The aim of the game is to memorize the order in which the orbs in the dungeon light up. If you guess them in the correct order, you win and can start again with a different puzzle! If you get one wrong, you'll hear a beep and have to start again!

The game was created using Unity 2017.1.0p4 and GVR SDK v1.60.0 and deployed on iPhone.
